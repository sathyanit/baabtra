<br />

A computer is a general purpose device that cand be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost same.
<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3>
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain many ALUs.



<h2 id="program">Programming language</h2><br />
<a href="#toc">GOTO TOP</a><br />
<br />

A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.
<h3 id="c">C</h3>
C ( as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
<h3 id="cpp">C++</h3>
C++ (pronounced cee plus plus) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.



<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2><br />
<a href="#toc">GOTO TOP</a><br />
<br />

Stands for "Database Management System." In short, a DBMS is a database program. Technically speaking, it is a software system that uses a standard method of cataloging, retrieving, and running queries on data. The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides ways for the data to be modified or extracted by users or other programs.

A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.Programming languages can be used to create programs that control behaviour of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.

<p style="color:#0033CC; font-size:18px">
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let <del>application</del> developres"write once,run anywhere"(WORA),meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recomplied to another.

Oxygen(O2) is one of the most important elements required to sustain life.Without it,our health begins to suffer and/or we die.Unhealthy or weak cells due to improper metabolism lose their natural immunity and are thus susceptible to viruses and lead the way to all kinds of serious health problems.
